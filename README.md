## How to get started?

1. `yarn` or `npm install` to install the required dependencies
2. `yarn dev` to kickoff the dev server, and open your browser window. Optionally you can run the following:
1 `yarn prod` or `npm run build` to run a build without starting the server

If you make changes to the tailwind config, you may need to stop and restart the browser-sync server for changes to apply.
